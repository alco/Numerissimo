    <p id="about-disclaimer"><b>Important</b>. The project is still in its early stage of development. It is a work in progress and most of the functionality is lacking. Once the project goes alpha (hopefully in the early 2012), I will focus more on the overeall usability of the site and I will also start promoting it to the masses.</p>

    <p>The main objective of this project is to help you learn and practice numerals in a foreign language. You may have found yourself in a situation when you've just completed a lesson in your Spanish textbook talking about numerals and you feel all confident. But then you turn on the radio and hear a narrator saying "En septiembre veintidos, mil novecientos noventa y siete..." Wait, what? Can you repeat a little slower please?</p>

    <p>The task of learning to spell and understand foreign numerals is quite lengthy. It can takes months to start grasping spoken numbers like you would in your native language. The reason it takes so much time is not because numerals are fundamentally difficult. They're not. But in general there's not much material to practice on. Textbook can give only a few excercises. Of course, you could go to the streets, so to speak, and start listening to people talking and using numbers in their speech and try to comprehend them. It is a viable approach, but I'd call it learning things the hard way. There's a simpler and more enjoyable way to practice.</p>

    <p>Enter Numerissimo. This project has grown out of a simple idea to create a tool which would allow you to learn spelling numbers in a foreign language of your choice, learn to understand spoken numbers and to practice this over and over until they come out naturally like if they were spoken in your own native language.</p>

    <p>If you can't wait to get started, that's great! Follow the steps in our <a href="#">Tutorial</a> and start practicing right away!</p>

    <p>If you would like to learn more about the project and, possibly, about its development and how you can participate, please go on reading.</p>
